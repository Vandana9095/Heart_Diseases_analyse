# Project Title – Short Description  
*(Example: Heart Disease Prediction – Healthcare Analytics Project)*

## 📌 Project Overview  
Briefly explain the problem and why it matters.  
Example:  
This project analyzes clinical health data to predict the likelihood of heart disease and identify key contributing factors. The goal is to support healthcare professionals with data-driven insights for better diagnosis.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- SQL (data queries)  
- Tableau / Power BI (dashboarding)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 Dataset  
- Source: [link or mention source]  
- Size: 300K+ rows, 10+ features (Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, etc.)  

## 🔎 Methodology  
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering & Selection  
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
5. Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)  
6. Visualization & Dashboarding  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Age, cholesterol, and chest pain type were top predictors of heart disease.  
- Random Forest model achieved **92% accuracy** with **high recall** (important for medical predictions).  
- Tableau dashboard enabled easy filtering by demographics for pattern exploration.  

 

## 🚀 Future Work  
- Hyperparameter tuning to further improve recall.  
- Deploying the model as a web app using Flask/Streamlit.
